        Every month we get together to see guest speakers, hear about field trips, and chat about botanical topics. Even if you're a non-member, you're welcome to come to our evening meetings. To help raise funds for Wellington BotSoc’s Jubilee Award Fund, members are encouraged to bring named seedlings or cuttings for sale at each evening meeting.

       	Evening meeting – New Zealand’s biodiversity strategies: looking back and looking forward
        <br/>
        <br/>
		Speaker: Dr Wren Green, Environmental consultant. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Cabinet has directed the Department of Conservation to complete a new National Biodiversity Strategy by December 2019. For Dr Wren Green, it’s an opportunity to look at the work he and Bruce Clarkson did on the current NZ Biosecurity Strategy before and after its release in February 2000. It’s also an opportunity to hear his views on the context and challenges facing those responsible for developing a Biodiversity Strategy that will satisfy the current Minister and Cabinet.
